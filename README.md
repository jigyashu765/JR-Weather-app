# JR-Weather-app
The Weather History Tracker is a web application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The primary goal of the project is to provide users with real-time weather information for a specified city and maintain a history of their weather searches. The application leverages a free weather API to fetch the latest weather data.
